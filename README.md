An application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows, and then add them to their "Watchlist".

After entering a search query, the page sends a request to the OMDB API, and the returned results are rendered on the page.

Adding an item to the list saves it in the browser's localStorage, allowing the results to be retained between sessions on the same device.
